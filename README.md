# AWS
AWS (or Cloud Computing in general) is the future. Since I started working as a data engineer, it's one of the most useful tools to learn, because it makes a lot easier to spin up the infrastructure necessary to create pipelines, transform data, run code and etc. 

The aim of this repository is to present some experiences of mine with some AWS services and invite anyone to try them out as well.
